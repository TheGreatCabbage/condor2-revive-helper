# Condor2 Revive Helper
A program to handle opening multiplayer sessions of Condor2 via Revive.

Condor2 is an excellent soaring simulator which features VR support via the Oculus SDK, forcing many great VR headsets to use Revive. Multiplayer sessions are launched by clicking a link which opens Condor2 directly, completely skipping the necessary step of injecting the executable into Revive.

The workaround is not painless: opening Condor2 via the link in non-VR mode, copying the IP address, closing Condor2, opening Condor2 via Revive and pasting in the IP address. This program, along with the [Condor2 Revive Extension](https://github.com/TheGreatCabbage/condor2-revive-extension) for Firefox and Chrome, aims to restore the simple process of clicking a link to open a multiplayer session with VR.

*Current status: work in progress.*
